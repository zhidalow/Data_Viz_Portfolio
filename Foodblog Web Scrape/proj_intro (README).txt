Data obtained from web scraping (using Scrapy) https://misstamchiak.com. Scraped data was saved to foodblogscrape/foodinfo.json. 
keep_uniques.py was then run to append new data to existing data foodblogscrape/foodinfo_active_file.csv (only latest 50 posts) & foodblogscrape/foodinfo_full_historical_data.csv (full history of posts).
Visualization was made using foodblogscrape/foodinfo_active_file.csv data.
